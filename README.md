# PrimesList


This python script analyzes and compares three different approaches to calculating the list of primes up to a given number:

1. The simplest and possibly worst algorithm
2. A polished and more efficient version of the previous algorithm
3. The sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
4. The sieve of Atkin, which has a theoretical better performance than the other algorithms, but actually depends on the implementation used. See (https://web.archive.org/web/20071011180805/http://krenzel.info/static/atkin.py) for an efficient code

the list of primes up to 10000 is computed and the execution time of each algorithm mesured and printed
