# PrimesList


This python script analyzes and compares three different approaches to calculating the list of primes up to a given number:

1. The simplest and worst possible algorithm
2. A polished and more efficient version of the previous algorithm
3. The sieve of Erathostenes algorithm

the list of primes up to 10000 is computed and the execution time of each algorithm mesured and printed
